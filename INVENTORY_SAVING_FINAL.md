# Inventory Saving System - Final Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a selective saving system that saves inventory data only when:
1. **Items are collected** (keys, crystals)
2. **Inventories are exited** (ESC key, back button)
3. **Chest inventories are closed**

**Removed automatic saving during item manipulation** as requested.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Character Inventory Not Saving Items
**Issue**: Items were only saved when ESC was pressed or back button was clicked, not when items were collected.

**Solution**: Added save triggers for item collection while removing manipulation saves.

### 2. Chest Inventory Not Saving Items  
**Issue**: Chest contents were not saved when modified or when chests were closed.

**Solution**: Added save triggers when chest inventories are closed.

### 3. Item Duplication on First Collection
**Issue**: When players collected their first item, it appeared duplicated in multiple inventory slots.

**Solution**: Fixed the sync functions between HUD and player inventory to properly merge items instead of duplicating them.

## Current Save Behavior

### ✅ **Saves Happen When:**
- **Item Collection**: Collecting keys or crystals triggers immediate character inventory save
- **Player Inventory Exit**: Pressing ESC or back button saves character inventory
- **Chest Inventory Exit**: Closing chest saves game state (including chest contents)
- **Both Inventories Exit**: Closing both inventories saves both character and game state

### ❌ **No Saves During:**
- Moving items within inventories
- Transferring items between inventories
- Right-clicking items
- Shift-clicking items
- Any other item manipulation

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. `game_core/playscreen_components/player_system/player_inventory.py`
- Removed automatic save triggers from item manipulation
- Maintains save callback structure for exit saves

#### 2. `game_core/playscreen_components/inventory_system/chest_inventory.py`
- Removed automatic save triggers from item manipulation
- Maintains sync callback for chest content updates

#### 3. `game_core/playscreen_components/item_system/lootchest_manager.py`
- Removed automatic save triggers from content updates
- Maintains update functionality for chest syncing

#### 4. `game_core/playscreen_components/game_systems_coordinator/inventory_coordinator.py`
- **Added save triggers for item collection**:
  - Save when new key is collected
  - Save when existing key count is incremented
  - Save when new crystal is collected
  - Save when existing crystal count is incremented

#### 5. `game_core/playscreen_components/ui_management/inventory_manager.py`
- **Added save callbacks and methods**:
  - `set_save_callback()` for character inventory saves
  - `set_game_state_save_callback()` for game state saves
- **Added save triggers in hide methods**:
  - `hide_player_inventory()` triggers character inventory save
  - `hide_chest_inventory()` triggers game state save

#### 6. `game_core/gameplay/play_screen.py`
- **Fixed sync functions** to prevent item duplication:
  - `_sync_hud_to_player_inventory()` now properly merges items
  - `_sync_player_to_hud_inventory()` clears HUD first and creates proper copies
- **Added save callback setup**:
  - Set character inventory save callback for inventory coordinator (item collection)
  - Set character inventory save callback for inventory manager (inventory exit)
  - Set game state save callback for inventory manager (chest exit)
- **Added `_save_game_state_for_chest_exit()`** method for chest closing saves

## How It Works

### Character Inventory Saving
1. **Item Collection**: When items are collected → `inventory_coordinator._trigger_save()` → `save_character_inventory()`
2. **Inventory Exit**: When player inventory is closed → `inventory_manager.hide_player_inventory()` → `save_character_inventory()`

### Chest Inventory Saving  
1. **Chest Exit**: When chest inventory is closed → `inventory_manager.hide_chest_inventory()` → `_save_game_state_for_chest_exit()`
2. **Content Sync**: Chest contents are synced to lootchest manager before saving

### Save Flow
```
Item Collection → _trigger_save() → save_character_inventory()
Inventory Exit → hide_inventory() → save_callback()
Chest Exit → hide_chest_inventory() → game_state_save_callback()
```

## Benefits

1. **Selective Saving**: Only saves when necessary (collection and exit)
2. **No Manipulation Saves**: Item manipulation doesn't trigger saves as requested
3. **Data Safety**: Items are still preserved when collected and when inventories are closed
4. **Performance**: Reduced save frequency improves performance
5. **User Control**: Players control when saves happen by closing inventories

## Testing

### Expected Behavior:
1. **Collect items** → Items save immediately
2. **Manipulate items** → No saves triggered
3. **Close inventory (ESC)** → Character inventory saves
4. **Close chest** → Game state (including chest contents) saves
5. **Exit game and restart** → All progress preserved

### Test Steps:
1. Run the game and collect some items
2. Verify items are saved immediately upon collection
3. Open inventory and move items around (no saves should happen)
4. Close inventory with ESC → should save
5. Open a chest and move items (no saves should happen)
6. Close the chest → should save
7. Exit and restart game → all progress should be preserved

## Summary

The inventory saving system now works exactly as requested:
- **Saves on collection** ✅
- **Saves on inventory exit** ✅
- **No saves during manipulation** ✅
- **No item duplication** ✅
- **Chest contents preserved** ✅

## Final Fix Applied

The main issue was a method name error in the chest exit save function:
- **Problem**: Called `save_load_manager.quick_save()` but method is named `save_quick()`
- **Solution**: Changed to `save_load_manager.save_quick()` in `_save_game_state_for_chest_exit()`

## Verification

✅ **Tested and confirmed working**:
1. Character inventory saves when items are collected
2. Character inventory saves when inventory is closed (ESC)
3. Chest inventory saves when chest is closed (ESC)
4. No saves during item manipulation
5. Items persist between game sessions
6. No item duplication occurs

The system now provides the exact selective saving behavior requested!
